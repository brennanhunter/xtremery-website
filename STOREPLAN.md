## üé™ The Chicken-and-Egg Solution

**Use Products as Traffic Drivers:**
1. **Free valuable content** attracts visitors
2. **Lead magnets** capture emails  
3. **Email nurturing** builds trust
4. **Product sales** generate revenue
5. **Happy customers** refer others
6. **Cycle repeats** with larger audience

This approach turns the traditional "build traffic then monetize" model on its head by using products as both traffic drivers AND revenue generators from the start.
