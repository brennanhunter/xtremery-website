# Targeting Strategy: Finding Coaches with Bad Websites

## üéØ **COACH-FOCUSED TARGETING STRATEGY**

*You're right - coaches are still the better market. Let's get strategic about finding the ones with genuinely bad websites.*

### **üé™ PERFECT NICHE: LIFE/RELATIONSHIP COACHES**

**Why coaches are PERFECT for your strategy:**
- **High-budget clients** ($2,000-5,000+ is normal for them)
- **Understand ROI** (they sell transformation, so they get business value)
- **Pain point:** Many coach websites don't match their expertise level
- **Your connection:** You're interested in coaching yourself = authentic understanding
- **Conversion-focused:** They NEED websites that convert visitors to clients

## üîç **WHERE TO FIND COACHES WITH BAD SITES**

### **1. OLDER COACH DIRECTORIES (Gold Mine!)**

**Psychology Today Coach Directory**
- Filter by "Life Coach" + "Relationship Coach"
- Look for profiles created 2018-2021 (they haven't updated)
- Many still link to outdated websites
- Coaches who joined early often have DIY sites

**Coach.com Directory**
- Less maintained than newer platforms
- Older coaches who built sites themselves
- Look for coaches with 10+ years experience (pre-good-templates era)

**LinkedIn Coach Searches**
- Search "Life Coach" + location
- Filter by "10+ years experience"
- Older coaches more likely to have outdated sites
- Many still have WordPress sites from 2015-2019

### **2. SPECIFIC SEARCH STRATEGIES**

**Google Search Modifiers:**
```
"life coach" site:wordpress.com
"relationship coach" "powered by WordPress"
"executive coach" [city] -squarespace -wix
"life coaching" "testimonials" 2018..2020
```

**Social Media Backtracking:**
- Find coaches on Instagram/Facebook with 5K+ followers
- Check their bio links - often outdated websites
- Established coaches who focused on social media first

### **3. TARGET SPECIFIC COACH TYPES**

**Higher Probability of Bad Sites:**
- **Career transition coaches** (often former corporate, DIY websites)
- **Relationship coaches 45+** (built sites before good templates)
- **Executive coaches** (focused on networking, not web presence)
- **Spiritual/holistic coaches** (anti-tech mindset, basic sites)
- **Coaches in smaller cities** (less web-savvy competition)

**Red Flag Indicators in Search Results:**
- URLs ending in `.wordpress.com` or `.wix.com` (free plans)
- Meta descriptions that say "Just another WordPress site"
- Titles with years in them ("John Smith Coaching - 2019")

## üéØ **REFINED TARGETING PROCESS**

### **Step 1: Use Advanced Search Techniques**

**LinkedIn Advanced Search:**
- Title: "Life Coach" OR "Executive Coach"
- Years of experience: 10+
- Location: Major cities (higher rates)
- Look for coaches with corporate backgrounds (often have budget but bad sites)

### **Step 2: Quick Site Assessment Checklist**

**Immediate Red Flags (30 seconds):**
- [ ] URL has wordpress.com or wix.com
- [ ] Footer says "Powered by WordPress" or shows year 2018-2020  
- [ ] Loads slowly on mobile
- [ ] Generic stock photos (not personal branding photos)
- [ ] Contact page is just a form (no booking system)
- [ ] Blog hasn't been updated in 6+ months
- [ ] No lead magnets or free resources
- [ ] Social media icons link to empty profiles

### **Step 3: Business Opportunity Assessment**

**Good Prospects Have:**
- High session rates ($150+) but basic website
- Strong social media presence but weak website
- Corporate background (indicates budget)
- Established practice (5+ years) but old website
- Active on LinkedIn but website doesn't match professionalism

## üìß **UPDATED OUTREACH FOR "BAD SITE" COACHES**

### **Email 1: Professional Gap Approach**
**Subject:** Your LinkedIn presence vs your website

*Hi [Name],*

*I came across your profile on LinkedIn and was impressed by your background in [specific area]. Your post about [recent LinkedIn post] really resonated with me.*

*I'm actually exploring coaching myself, so I visited your website to learn more about your approach. I noticed there's a bit of a gap between your professional LinkedIn presence and your website experience.*

*As someone who builds websites specifically for coaches, I see this often - successful coaches who've focused on building their practice but haven't updated their web presence to match their expertise.*

*Would you be interested in seeing what a website that matches your LinkedIn professionalism could look like? I could put together a quick mockup just to show the potential.*

*Best,*
*Hunter*

*P.S. I'm not trying to sell you anything - just genuinely curious about coaching and thought this might be helpful.*

### **Email 2: The Competitive Analysis**
**Subject:** I compared your website to [competitor]

*Hi [Name],*

*I was researching [type] coaches and came across both you and [competitor name]. You both have similar experience and credentials, but I noticed a significant difference in web presence.*

*[Competitor] has a modern, conversion-optimized site while yours appears to be built on an older platform. Since many potential clients compare coaches online before booking, this could be affecting your inquiry volume.*

*I specialize in helping established coaches modernize their web presence to match their expertise. Would you be interested in a brief call to discuss how this might impact your practice?*

*Best,*
*Hunter*

## üé™ **YOUR COACH POSITIONING**

**Website headline:** "Lightning-Fast Websites That Help Coaches Convert More Visitors Into Clients"

**Your unique angle:** "As someone passionate about coaching myself, I understand what makes potential clients trust and book with coaches. Most coach websites are slow WordPress sites that lose 32% of visitors before they even load. I build custom, lightning-fast sites that create the right first impression for your transformational work."

## üìû **SAMPLE DISCOVERY CALL STRUCTURE**

1. **Pain discovery:** "What's your biggest challenge with getting clients from your website?"
2. **Current state:** "How many website visitors do you get monthly? How many convert to consultations?"
3. **Performance reveal:** "I ran a test on your site - it takes X seconds to load, which typically costs coaches about X% of potential clients"
4. **Solution fit:** "I specialize in rebuilding coach websites with custom code that loads in under 1 second"
5. **Social proof:** "I just helped [another coach] increase inquiries by 40% with this approach"
6. **Close:** "Would you like me to create a proposal showing exactly how this would work for your practice?"

## üéØ **SUCCESS INDICATORS**

**You've found a good prospect when:**
- LinkedIn shows $200+ session rates
- Website looks like it's from 2018-2020
- Strong credentials but basic web presence
- Active on social media but website doesn't match
- Contact process is just email (no booking system)

## üîß **REFINED TARGETING STRATEGY**

*Addressing concerns about tool selection and target identification*

### **üìä BETTER AUDIT TOOLS THAN PAGESPEED INSIGHTS**

**Problem with PageSpeed Insights:** Many sites will score decent but still have business problems.

**Better audit approach:**

#### **1. GTmetrix (More Detailed)**
- Shows actual load times (not just scores)
- Waterfall charts reveal specific bottlenecks
- Mobile vs desktop performance gaps
- Historical tracking data

#### **2. WebPageTest.org (Professional Level)**
- Real device testing
- Video captures of loading process
- Multiple location testing
- Connection speed simulation

#### **3. Business Impact Analysis (Your Secret Weapon)**
Instead of just speed, audit:
- **Conversion funnel problems** - Hard to find contact info, confusing navigation
- **Mobile experience gaps** - Desktop-first design that fails on phones
- **Trust/credibility issues** - No testimonials, poor design quality
- **Lead generation weaknesses** - No lead magnets, weak call-to-actions

### **üéØ REVISED TARGETING CRITERIA**

**Instead of just "slow WordPress sites," look for:**

#### **Visual Red Flags:**
- **Outdated design** (looks like 2015)
- **Poor mobile experience** (test on your phone)
- **Weak calls-to-action** (generic "Contact Us" buttons)
- **No social proof** (missing testimonials/reviews)
- **Confusing navigation** (too many menu items)
- **No lead magnets** (no free resources to capture emails)

#### **Business Red Flags:**
- **High session prices but basic website** (mismatch indicates opportunity)
- **No online booking system** (losing clients to friction)
- **No email capture** (missing lead generation)
- **Poor SEO** (hard to find in Google searches)

### **üîç IMPROVED PROSPECT IDENTIFICATION PROCESS**

#### **Step 1: Find Coaches with High Potential**
**Search terms:**
- "life coach [expensive city]" (Beverly Hills, Manhattan, Scottsdale)
- "executive coach [business hub]" (Silicon Valley, Seattle, Austin)
- "relationship coach [affluent suburb]"

**Price indicators of good prospects:**
- Session rates $200+ (indicates they can afford $2,000+ websites)
- Corporate coaching mentioned (B2B rates are higher)
- "Premium" or "Exclusive" in their messaging

#### **Step 2: Quick Website Assessment**
**30-second evaluation:**
1. **Load their site on mobile** - Does it feel slow/clunky?
2. **Try to book a session** - Is the process smooth?
3. **Look for lead magnets** - Any free resources offered?
4. **Check testimonials** - Professional photos/video or just text?
5. **View source** - WordPress/template indicators

#### **Step 3: Business Impact Audit**
**Create a "Business Impact Assessment" instead of just speed test:**

**Sample audit points:**
- ‚ùå Takes 3.2 seconds to load on mobile (32% visitor drop-off)
- ‚ùå No lead magnet on homepage (missing 80% of visitors who aren't ready to book)
- ‚ùå Contact form buried on separate page (reduces inquiries by 40%)
- ‚ùå No social proof above fold (trust issues cost 25% of conversions)
- ‚ùå Generic "Contact Us" button (specific CTAs convert 161% better)

### **üìß UPDATED OUTREACH APPROACH**

#### **New Email 1: Business Impact Focus**
**Subject:** 5 ways your website might be costing you clients

*Hi [Name],*

*I was researching life coaches in [area] and came across your practice. Your approach to [specific thing] really caught my attention.*

*As someone considering coaching myself, I ended up analyzing several coach websites from a potential client's perspective. I noticed a few patterns that might be costing coaches like you potential clients.*

*I put together a quick assessment of your site showing 5 specific areas that could be impacting your client acquisition. Nothing major, but small changes that could make a big difference.*

*Would you like me to send it over? No charge - just thought you'd find it valuable.*

*Best,*
*Hunter*

*P.S. I'm actually building websites specifically for coaches now because I understand the unique challenges you face in building trust online.*

### **üéØ BETTER TARGET EXAMPLES**

**Instead of looking for "slow sites," look for:**

1. **High-priced coaches with basic websites**
   - $300/session but looks like a $50 template

2. **Coaches with great content but poor UX**
   - Amazing blog posts but terrible navigation

3. **Successful coaches with outdated sites**
   - Clearly established practice but 2018-era design

4. **Coaches missing obvious conversions**
   - No email capture, no booking system, weak CTAs

### **üí° THE KEY INSIGHT**

**You're not selling speed improvements - you're selling client acquisition improvements.**

**New positioning:** "I help established coaches turn more website visitors into paying clients through better user experience and conversion optimization."

**This approach works because:**
- Coaches understand client acquisition costs
- You can demonstrate clear ROI
- Less technical, more business-focused
- Easier to prove value than pure speed metrics
