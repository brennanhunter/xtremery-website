# Client Acquisition Strategy

## üé£ **CLIENT ACQUISITION STRATEGY FOR PATH 1**

*The critical question: How do we actually get $1,500-3,500 clients for a Next.js specialist?*

### **üéØ THE LEAD GENERATION REALITY**

**Your Current Challenge:** You mentioned "poor networking" and "marketing/lead generation" as obstacles. Path 1 requires targeting remote clients who don't know you exist yet.

**The Good News:** Next.js specialists are in high demand, but you need to fish where the fish are.

## üî• **PROVEN CLIENT ACQUISITION CHANNELS**

### **CHANNEL 1: DEV COMMUNITY AUTHORITY** *(Highest ROI)*
**Timeline:** 2-3 months to see results
**Investment:** 5-10 hours/week

**Strategy:**
- **Twitter/X presence** - Share Next.js tips, performance wins, before/after metrics
- **LinkedIn articles** - "Why Your WordPress Site is Costing You Customers"
- **Dev.to blog posts** - Technical tutorials with subtle portfolio showcases
- **GitHub showcase** - Open source components, performance optimizations

### **CHANNEL 2: REVERSE COLD OUTREACH** *(Fastest results)*
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks to first client
**Investment:** 2-3 hours/day

**Strategy:**

- **Offer free speed audit** as lead magnet

**Script Example:**
*"Hey [Name], I was checking out [their site] and ran it through some performance tools. Your site has great content but takes 4.2 seconds to load on mobile - that's costing you about 40% of potential conversions. I made a quick video audit showing the specific issues and how fixing them could impact your business. Want me to send it over? No charge, just thought you'd find it interesting. - Hunter"*

### **CHANNEL 3: AGENCY PARTNERSHIPS** *(Most scalable)*

**Pitch:** "I help WordPress agencies deliver lightning-fast sites their clients love, without the agency having to learn React/Next.js"

### **CHANNEL 4: NICHE DOMINATION** *(Long-term goldmine)*
**Timeline:** 3-6 months to establish authority
**Investment:** Deep focus on 1-2 industries
