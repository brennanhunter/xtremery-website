I am a person who likes Windows 10 and does not want to buy 2 new computers or be held ransome by Microsoft to extend basic updates for windows 10 for another year. So after a lot of research, I found out that I can continue to use windows 10 for another several years quite safely if I take certain steps which require computer skills which I don't have.
After several phone calls talking with business that did not want to discuss my issues, I called Xtremery where my call was answered by Hunter. What a breath of fresh air! He was highly knowledgable, patient, down to earth and interested in actually helping me out with my situation. He also was flexible in getting me into his schedule quickly and very fair in his pricing.
Long story short, my goals were 100% met at a very fair price and I have a person that I know I can count on for any and all of my future computer needs. I recomend him highly and without reservations of any kind.

Running into a problem with my computer that I had never seen before, Hunter was able to take in my computer and have it fixed up the next day. He is very good at fixing up computers and very good at communicating what needed to be done. I will be brining back any computer again if I run into any more trouble.

I was looking for someone to come look at my PC because it would not play my games correctly i called about 10 PC repairs shops because it was friday nobody wanted to come and look at it until I called Hunter he was willing to come to my house on Halloween and check out my rig. Hunter is amazing, funny and is willing to teach others the most important thing was he fixed my PC with 1 hour and the price was cheap. I have him coming back to replace some RGB wires in my PC amazing guy with excellent prices he is my PC Tech from today on wouldn't call anyone else. Thanks Hunter

I went on Google to find a guy that will do a simple job on my PC. I contemplated doing it myself but really wanted professional hands on it. I called Hunter and he did the job fast and correctly. He was cool, straight to the point, and easy to work with. It’s nice to have a guy, whether it’s a plumber, an electrician, a landscaper, etc. As an adult, you rely on your guys. Now, Hunter is my PC guy for as long as he’s doing this. 😎🙂

Hunter rocks😎 My computer problem was reportedly easy, he fixed that in a day and said anyone could do it. What’s not easy is overcoming the panic you feel when your device is infected by malware. Hunter welcomed me into his home, answered all my uneducated questions with a smile, and made me feel like it was going to be alright. THAT was worth every (very reasonable) penny. Plus he has good taste in books!

The most important thing to me is reliability, & here you’re surely going to get that! The fix process on my laptop was deliberately taken with care & methodology to ensure both me & Hunter came to a conclusion. If you’re looking for genuine care for your product & care for what you receive, this is my recommendation!

Hunter did an excellent job helping me build my website exactly the way I wanted. He was super collaborative, understood my preferences, and translated my ideas into a clean, professional-looking site. The entire process was smooth, and he was always quick to respond whenever I needed changes or suggestions. Definitely recommend his services to anyone looking for reliable and high-quality work.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I spilled a good amount of water on my laptop keyboard and had called the typical repair franchises in town, who all told me that it was probably a lost cause and they didn't even think they could recover the data from my hard drive.

Well, Hunter both recovered my data and got my laptop to boot up again! Super glad I brought it to him.

Very low pricing, also!

I took my HP laptop to hunter to fix a problem with the loading of windows 10. He saw me the same day and let me wait till he fixed it for me in less than 2 hrs. He is very good at what he does and explained the fix to me. The cost was very reasonable. He also is a very nice person. He will do a good job for you.

I had a great experience getting help with my computer issues. He was incredibly knowledgeable, patient, and took the time to explain things clearly. What really stood out was that he followed up afterward to make sure everything was still working properly. It’s rare to find that level of care and professionalism these days. Highly recommend!
